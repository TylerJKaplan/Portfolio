                    <p>As another California winter approaches and passes in its usual blur, I'm reminded of the pleasantly unsettling nature of living here. The seasons aren't marked by leaves shifting into autumn reds or a light dusting of snow easing us into winter. They are not represented by a gradual temperature shift. The season is marked by the manicured rows of suburbia transforming their blank facade abruptly into Christmas light shows.</p>
                    
                    <p>This quick change in the suburban landscape is what grounds you in a sense of time and progression. I never realized how odd this was until I presided in the midwest, where flurries and below freezing were commonplace. Where the abundance of trees slowly flow from vibrant greens to dainty yellows and the dark reflection of orange, eventually browning and becoming bare. The occasional snowfall dusting the branches, rooftops and streets. Winters so cold that a snowfall in November will persist until March. There is something comforting in the harshness of the seasons. The stinging of the morning air on a pale face. The bone piercing cold cutting  through your layers of clothing, flesh, and blood. The ice crunching beneath the weight of each step. Everyone drudging alone, united in misery. There is something disconcerting with a 70 degree December day. It lacks a shared experience, that glance to a passerby signifying "Fuck this" is replaced by a gentle wave and soft smile.</p>
                    
                    <p>Two years have passed since leaving the midwest yet it feels like I am just getting back. I struggle to think I may reside here the rest of my life, never experiencing the subtle beauty of changing seasons. Not seeing the snow except the occasional mountain trip, then it is back to sun and surf. Socializing by the putrid warmth of a gas fire instead of the visceral sensations of a wood burning pit.</p>
                    
                    <p>You trade in boots for sandals. Dark liquors for American pilsners and your meal is always garnished with an avocado. The Christmas lights eventually come down from the rooftops of beach cottages you'll never afford, their glow disappearing as suddenly as it arrived. And with that small, rehearsed gesture, California decides winter is over.</p>
                    
                    <p>And so another California winter ends, not with cold or color or any sign that the world has shifted, but with the simple, unnerving truth that it never really arrived at all.</p>

                    <p> Every Saturday, I equip a canvas tote bag brimming with items my pockets cannot contain:  wallet, keys, pocket radio with wired earbuds, flip phone, digital camera, notebook, pen, one pack of ZYN, and whatever book I am currently reading.</p>

                    <p> Upon entering the world, I begin battling my thoughts. “You are being performative.” That barista thinks I am a clown. The teens driving their E-bikes know I am another male archetype. The lady walking her goldendoodle. She doesn’t care. She’s not chronically online. Yet, I still think she does.</p>
                    
                    <p> Take the humble book. By reading it in public, I signal “I am better than you”. Truthfully, it’s my goal to read more. Just one book a month. And I like doing that in the park or the beach or while the judgmental barista is whisking my matcha.</p>

                    <p> There can be a similar case made for all of these items. The wired headphones are cheap yet durable. They don’t completely block out the world, so I can hear the birds chirping and the rickety swing set while my music hums in the background.</p>

                    <p> The camera helps me explore new areas with intention. Looking for interesting buildings and moments to document. I want to remember this beautiful day. How the sun dances between the leaves on the trees. How their shadows fall on the concrete. How the abandoned building contrasts against the large sign proclaiming “King of BBQ”.</p>

                    <img src="images/R0000186.jpg" class="small">
                    
                    <p> The flip phone means I can stay in contact with the people I love without the ability to scroll whenever I remember I am bored. I cannot bust it out when I make eye contact with the man in the F-150 who’s also waiting for the light to turn.</p>

                    <p> I pop the ZYN in whenever the feelings start to creep in. The slow release of nicotine traveling from my gums into my brain deafens the anxiety of carrying this tote bag.</p>

                    <p> The note pad lets me scribble a quick thought:</p>

                    <p>  “If you’re constantly searching for meaning you’ll never find it”</p>

                    <p> There is something there, but I quickly downplay any interesting idea I have.</p>

                    <p> The radio. The radio because I like the static when I listen to a Dodger game. The broadcaster wading in and out of the soft noisy sea helps elevate the rhythm of the game. I want to hear music that someone else curated. I am tired of my playlists. I like listening to some classical music on these aimless strolls. Yeah I can do that on Spotify but then I don't have that soft voice telling me “That was Ludwig van Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14, performed by Rober Safdie of the Portland Orchestra and you’re listening to KUSC, supported by listeners like you.” A special moment between me and the host, transmitted over the invisible waves.</p>

                    <p> I got to hear from a lovely lady talking about the state of the restaurant industry in Orange County. Arthur & Sons Steak and Bourbon is reopening in Downtown Disney after a “reconceptualization" all the while Toast in Costa Mesa is closing, never having recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. I got to hear her dismisvely say the "Irvine Spectrum". Her tone full of disdain because she and the listeners of public radio both know the “Irvine spectrum” is a manicured corporate hellscape where creativity goes to die and themed chain restaurants thrive.</p>

                    <p> I did not catch her name, and I probably never will but that is the beauty. These are just some of the joys being a performative male can bring you.</p>

                    <p> At the top I lied, I do not do this every Saturday. I am afraid of what others will think. I am a man in search of meaning in the modern world and my gear proves it. These items are not making anything better when I let my negative thoughts win. I let shame and fear control me. Sucking the joy out of items I once found utility in. But we all know it is not the objects. It is me.</p>

                    <p> “Nobody cares unless I think they do.”</p>

                      <p>Drinking is dangerous. But not in the cool way free climbing or snowboarding is. It’s dangerous in its ability to slowly pull you in and never let go. As a kid you fear quick sand will be your demise. When you grow up, you learn it is the bottle.</p>
                      <p>I have not read the scientific literature but I have seen enough 50-year olds bellied up at the bar celebrating their 30th birthday to know drinking is not good for you. They clock in and out like a job whose purpose is not to provide for one's family but to slowly tear it apart. I'm sure every reader has their version of the tale, yet we persist. </p>
                      <p>Maybe it is because we do not care. You're doomed for mediocrity or, if you're lucky, war.  It’s possible drinking makes life just good enough to keep going. Life is not always worth living, but seven beers and a pen rip remind you that the robot gunning for your job has never felt this good in its life. And the next morning makes you realize it has never felt this bad in its life either. But at least you're alive.</p> 
                      <p>There is beauty in this dichotomy. Drinking is equal parts making memories and forgetting them. It’s overindulging at the company happy-hour while forgetting about tomorrow's meeting. It’s wiping away your insecurities and waking up with new ones. It’s forgetting for a few minutes that your president or that “not your president” is a pedophile. </p>
                      <p>Drinking has led to some of my favorite memories, but eventually this pursuit of new memories becomes reductive. Instead of forming them, you sit around a table engaging in the lowest form of conversation "Remember when…”</p> 
                      <p>I have not quite reached that age. I have enough in the tank to humbly submit myself to the cold beer once again. Attempting to make more memories I’ll surely forget.  Steadily sinking into a grave of my own design. But maybe I’m okay with that.</p>
