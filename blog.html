                    <p>Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now, and I finally decided to just go for it. This space is going to be a mix of my thoughts on design, photography, life in California, and whatever else catches my attention.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've always loved the aesthetic of old operating systems - there's something charming about the simplicity and directness of Windows 98. No unnecessary animations, no bloated interfaces, just pure functionality with a bit of personality. That's what I'm going for here.</p>

                    <p class="image-caption">My usual workspace where most of these posts will be written</p>
                    
                    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                    <p>I'll be sharing insights from my design work, behind-the-scenes looks at projects I'm working on, photography adventures around Southern California, and maybe some musings on creativity and the creative process. I'm not trying to be an expert - just sharing my journey.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that resonates with you.</p>

                    <p>As another California winter approaches and passes in its usual blur, I'm reminded of the pleasantly unsettling nature of living here.The seasons aren't marked by leaves shifting into autumn reds or a light dusting of snow easing us into winter. They are not represented by a gradual temperature shift. The season is marked by the manicured rows of suburbia transforming their blank facade abruptly into Christmas light shows.</p>
                    
                    <p>This quick change in the suburban landscape is what grounds you in a sense of time and progression. I never realized how odd this was until I presided in the midwest, where flurries and below freezing were commonplace. Where the abundance of trees slowly flow from vibrant greens to dainty yellows and the dark reflection of orange, eventually browning and becoming bare. The occasional snowfall dusting the branches, rooftops and streets. Winters so cold that a snowfall in November will persist until March. There is something comforting in the harshness of the seasons. The stinging of the morning air on a pale face. The bone piercing cold cutting  through your layers of clothing, flesh, and blood. The ice crunching beneath the weight of each step. Everyone drudging alone, united in misery. There is something disconcerting with a 70 degree December day. It lacks a shared experience, that glance to a passerby signifying "Fuck this" is replaced by a gentle wave and soft smile.</p>
                    
                    <p>Two years have passed since leaving the midwest yet it feels like I am just getting back. I struggle to think I may reside here the rest of my life, never experiencing the subtle beauty of changing seasons. Not seeing the snow except the occasional mountain trip, then it is back to sun and surf. Socializing by the putrid warmth of a gas fire instead of the visceral sensations of a wood burning pit.</p>
                    
                    <p>You still stumble into the bar with friends and strangers alike. You still order a beer but it pales in comparison to entering a warm pub, heat blasting, shaking off your boots, hanging your coat, and ordering a Guinness. Watching as the bartender attentively pours your carmelly rich elixir, tends to other patrons for a moment only to return to your now settled beverage and tops it off with a nice creamy head. The first sip regulating your body temperature bringing it back to a much needed equilibrium.</p>
                    
                    <p>You trade in boots for sandals. Dark liquors for American pilsners and your meal is always garnished with an avocado. The Christmas lights eventually come down from the rooftops of beach cottages you'll never afford, their glow disappearing as suddenly as it arrived. And with that small, rehearsed gesture, California decides winter is over.</p>
                    
                    <p>And so another California winter ends, not with cold or color or any sign that the world has shifted, but with the simple, unnerving truth that it never really arrived at all.</p>

                    <p>I've been thinking a lot lately about minimalism in design. Not the sterile, personality-free kind of minimalism that feels cold and corporate, but thoughtful simplicity that serves a purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I'm working on a project, whether it's a brand identity or a website, I always start by asking: what's the core message? What absolutely needs to be here? Everything else is negotiable.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Power of Constraints</h3>
                    <p>Working within constraints - whether it's a limited color palette, a specific grid system, or even the Windows 98 aesthetic of this site - actually makes me more creative, not less. When you can't rely on throwing every bell and whistle at a problem, you have to think more carefully about each choice.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561998338-13ad7883b20f?w=600" alt="Design sketches">
                    <p class="image-caption">Early sketches for a recent branding project</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's the thing about "less is more" - it's not a universal truth. Sometimes more IS more. Sometimes a design needs to be loud, chaotic, maximalist. The trick is knowing when to apply which approach.</p>
                    
                    <p>I think that's what makes design interesting - there's no formula. Every project is different, every client has different needs, and what worked brilliantly last time might fall flat this time. You have to stay flexible, stay curious.</p>

                    <p>Building this portfolio site has been such a fun project. I wanted something that felt personal, something that stood out from all the minimalist, modern portfolio sites out there. Don't get me wrong - I love a good minimal site - but I wanted to do something different.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Windows 98 aesthetic just clicked. It's nostalgic without being precious about it. It's functional. It's familiar. And honestly, it's just fun to look at.</p>

                    <h3>The Technical Approach</h3>
                    <p>I'm using the 98.css library as a foundation, which gives me all those classic Windows UI elements. From there, it's about adapting modern web development practices to work within this retro framework. CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts, vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, and careful attention to making everything feel authentic.</p>
                    
                    <p>The challenge is balancing authenticity with usability. I want it to feel like Windows 98, but I don't want to recreate all the frustrations of 90s web design. So it's a careful dance between nostalgia and modern UX principles.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're reading this on the actual site (as opposed to viewing the code), I hope you're enjoying the experience. And if you have thoughts or feedback, I'd love to hear them!</p>
